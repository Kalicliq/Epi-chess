# Epi-chess
A multiplayer chess game made in SFML

The server is developed by me and hosted on a raspberry

How the server work:
When someone want to play the server put them on a queue.

Then if 2 people are waiting they are put together to play a match.

For now the bishop the queen and the king are not coded so there are no restricted on their move.
Please be fair play ! :)

== TO DO ==

*display opponent name

*en passant rule

*code bishop, queen, king

*detect Check and Checkmate

*elo system
